Introducing Daniel, a physicist with a master's degree in quantum physics and cosmology who embarked on an inspiring journey from theoretical physics to the exciting realm of artificial intelligence (AI). During his tenure at the Data Innovation Lab, he spent over two years as a Full-time Lead Data Scientist, mastering project management, data analysis, Python programming, machine learning, neural networks, and data science.

In this role, Daniel excelled in creating end-to-end AI solutions, designing innovative AI applications, and monitoring machine learning pipelines with dashboards and metrics. He also explored diverse AI applications, ranging from political analysis to enhancing social interactions.

Daniel didn't stop there. As an Adjunct Professor at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, he shared his knowledge in "Financial Derivatives and Risk Management," teaching students to compute prices, perform statistical analysis using Python, and simulate derivative prices using Monte Carlo methods.

Currently, he is a Senior Data Scientist at Newtonlab Space, where he continues to contribute his expertise in data analysis, programming, Python, machine learning, neural networks, and data science to drive innovation.

Daniel's remarkable transition from quantum physics to AI exemplifies his adaptability, passion for learning, and commitment to excellence, making him a valuable asset to the data science and AI community.
